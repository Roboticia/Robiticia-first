## Onshape version
The up to date hardware version is made with [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/), which is a proprietary online CAD software, free to use for public projects.

You can view and modify the hardware parts on Onshape ([link of the onshape project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/57024ba6e4b0bd431e251b54/v/f9f9475a8e982b501b19085f/e/ed40471c06b378f3c094c206)), but an account (free) is required.


## OpenScad version
Poppy Ergo Starter was originally made by Jonathan Grizou (@jgrizou) with [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/).
This was inspired by the [Metabot project](https://github.com/Rhoban/Metabot/).

The OpenScad version of hardware is kept [here](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-starter/tree/OpenSCAD) for memory and educational example of an OpenScad project, but it is __no longer maintained__.
